I will think about a proper description later

How to run on Windows (It should work on mac, i dont know how to compile)
1. Open project folder (src) in VS
2. Open console as PowerShell
3. Run (only once): g++ main.cpp BubbleSort.cpp InsertionSort.cpp ShellSort.cpp MergeSort.cpp ArrayGenerator.cpp Files.cpp Memory.cpp CSV.cpp -o sort 
4. Run: .\sort.exe
5. Test
6. Outputs are automatically stored in a CSV file, so its easy to benchmark
