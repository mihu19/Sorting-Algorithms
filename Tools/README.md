## Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x** 
* Libraries: **pandas, matplotlib** 
* **Executable**: A compiled sort.exe (not included in this script list) must be present in the root directory to run the benchmarks.

**RunBenchmarks.py:** Automates data collection by feeding parameters (size, type, algorithm) into the executable and capturing the results.

**DiagramMaker - IndividualAlgo.py:** Creates high-detail, dual-pane performance charts (Log Time & Memory) for a single selected algorithm.

**DiagramMaker - AllAlgos.py:** Generates grouped bar charts to compare execution time or memory usage across multiple algorithms simultaneously.
